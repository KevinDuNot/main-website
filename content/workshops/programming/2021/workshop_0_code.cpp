(1) N = 1
We have no choice of where to move, we need to stay on the same square K times
But K can be huge, so we can't just add the value of the square every step K times
With some quick maths we find that the answer is just A[1]*K, so we don't actually need to simulate all the steps

This is O(1)

/*
(2) M = 1 and K = 1
We start on the first square and want to get as many points as we can!
Sound familiar?
With a standard prefix sum array, pre[i] will give us the number of points we get if we jump from square 1 to square i
Just find the max of the prefix sum array

This is O(N)
*/
/*
(3) K = 1
We can follow a similar technique to subtask 2.
Instead of a standard prefix sum array, we can go backwards from M to find the number of points we get if we jump left.
Then we can go forwards from M like a standard prefix array to find the number of points if we jump right.
The code will look something like

pre[M] = A[M];
for (int i = M-1; i >= 0; i--) pre[i] = pre[i+1]+A[i];
for (int i = M+1; i <= N; i++) pre[i] = pre[i-1]+A[i];

Then just find the maximum of pre.

This is O(N)
*/
/*
(4) All A[i] >= 0
The largest number of points we can get is jumping the entire array, so either from the very left to the very right or in the opposite direction.
The best solution will be taking one jump either to the very left or the very right (whichever gives the most points), then continuously jumping the whole array.
If we calculate pre as in subtask 3, the value of jumping to the very left in the first jump is pre[1].
The value of jumping to the very right in the first jump is pre[N].
Then our first jump takes the larger of pre[1] and pre[N].
The rest of the jumps all have the same value, the sum of the entire array.
Just like subtask 1, we can't simulate the jumps, so we need an equation to give us the answer.
Let's call the sum of the entire array S.
The solution is max(pre[1],pre[K])+(K-1)*S

This is O(N)
*/
/*
(5) All A[i] <= 0
The optimal solution here is to continuously jump on one square. Clearly jumping across multiple squares will give less points than jumping on one square, at least for that jump.

However, you can't just keep jumping on the starting square.
Consider N=2, M=1, K=2, A = [-100, -1].
The optimal solution here is to jump to the -1 and jump on itself, which gives -101-1 = -102.
Jumping on the -100 twice gives -200.

We also can't just go to the largest square and jump on it.
Consider N=4, M=2, K=2, A = [-2, -10, -100, -1]
Here it is optimal to jump to the -2 and jump on itself, giving -14 points.
If you jump to the -1 and jump on itself, then you get -112 points.

Q: Well how do we know which square we want to jump to?
A: Just try them all!

If we compute pre like in subtasks 3 and 4, we get the array showing the score we get on the first jump if we jump to that square.
The final answer if we jump to square i and jump on itself repeatedly is pre[i]+(K-1)*A[i].
Let's say solution[i] = pre[i]+(K-1)*A[i].
Then our answer is just the largest value in solution.

This is O(N)
*/
/*
(6) K = 2
Say for our first jump we jump from M to i. For our second jump we should get as many points as possible.
This should be easy to convince yourself of. If we have already jumped from M to i,
then to maximise our total points we just want to maximise our next jump.
Then we should calculate the maximum jump from every such i, as well as the value of the jump from M to i.
The latter is done with the pre array from the previous three subtasks.

The former is done with something called Kadane's algorithm (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/)
Essentially, the largest contiguous subarray ending at i either contains the largest contiguous subarray ending at i-1, or is just the element itself.
If the largest contiguous subarray ending at i-1 is positive, we take it, otherwise we don't.
The code will look something like

for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    if (max_end[i-1] > 0) max_end[i] += max_end[i-1];
    max_end[i] += A[i];
}

However, max_end[i] will give the maximum score ONLY for jumping to the left!
How do we account for jumping to the right?
If we apply Kadane's algorithm in reverse, we can get the largest contiguous subarray starting at i.

for (int i = N; i >= 1; i--) {
    if (max_start[i+1] > 0) max_start[i] += max_start[i+1];
    max_start[i] += A[i];
}

Then the largest jump we can make from i is just the largest between max_end[i] and max_start[i].
Then the overall solution is the largest of pre[i]+max(max_end[i],max_start[i]).
For the sake of simplicity we will set max_all[i] = max(max_end[i],max_start[i])

This is O(N)
*/
/*
(7) M = 1
It turns out that the observations we made previously applies to K > 2 too.
That is, we want to jump to a square i, then from i we want to take the largest point jump possible to j.
Then from j we want to jump back to i, then back to j and so on.
The proof is too large to fit in this comment (haha funny math reference).
But really this is a lot more difficult to prove, and you will have to work with some diagrams and try to find counterexamples to convince yourself.

The solution is max(pre[i]+max_all[i]*(K-1)) for all 1 <= i <= N.
Remember we calculated pre and max_all in O(N) each.

This is O(N)
*/
/*
FINAL SOLUTION
So we actually skipped a couple of steps. There are some observations we could have made specifically for having the first jump going to the right,
which would have been for the final subtask. But we generalised the jumps so our solution to the last subtask is also the final solution.
The code will look something like the following.
