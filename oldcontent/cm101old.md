The main competition at UNSW is the [Simon Marais Mathematics Competition](https://www.simonmarais.org/). This is based on the North American [William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition](https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition).

## Resources
- AMT's [Problem Solving Tactics](https://shop.amt.edu.au/collections/advanced-problem-solving/products/pst) is a good light introduction to competitive mathematics, suitable for anyone who has done intermediate high school mathematics.
- [Parabola](https://www.parabola.unsw.edu.au/) by UNSW's School of Mathematics and Statistics is published three times a year and contains a collection of problems with solutions released in the next issue.
- Past Simon Marais Mathematics Competition problem and solutions can be found on their website.
- Past William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition problems can be found [here](https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/).
